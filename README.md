# IdentityServerClient

IdentityServerClient is a project designed to help new and existing users of IdentityServer3 to create and execute calls to IdentityServer3 instances, as well as process the responses from those calls. This project was originally started as part of Broadview Networkâ€™s drive to integrate IdentityServer3, enable Identity Federation and a common login point across the enterprise. Since IdentityServer3 is an open source project the team at Broadview Networks felt that this project should be open source as well to give back to the community that has given us so much.
